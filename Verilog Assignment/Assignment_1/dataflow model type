1. What is the value of y in binary format in the below snippet?
reg [5:0] y;
initial
begin
y= 'Ox2;
end
SOLUTION: y= 'Ox2; This is invalid . So, compilation error occurs.

2. What is the value of the b in the below snippet?
integer b;
initial
begin
b= -‘d12/3;
end
SOLUTION: -4

3. What value is passed across the port b in the below snippet?
module test(output [32:0]b);
real a=14.5;
assign b = a;
endmodule
SOLUTION: assign b = a;
          Let us see LHS and RHS .First RHS is real number (14.5).Now, LHS 'b'  is net/reg(vector).When we assign real to reg/net then fractional part is discarded.
          b = 00000000000000000000000000001110
 
4. Find the value of the variable t at 1ns & 20 ns respectively from the below snippet.
time = t;
initial begin
#10 t= $time;
#20 ;
end
SOLUTION: This code has syntax error in which "time = t;" is invalid 
           If its time t;
          Then the output is 1ns=x(unknown)
                             20ns=10 

5. Write an RTL snippet to initialize all the locations of an array of size:10x8 to 0 at 0ns. Depth= 10, Width = 8bits
SOLUTION:
module array_module;
reg [7:0] my_array [0:9];
initial begin
integer i;
  for (i = 0; i < 10; i = i + 1) begin
       my_array[i] = 8'b0;
  end
end
endmodule

6. What will be the value of the parameter constant for the instance DUT in the top module from the below snippet?
module test;
parameter WIDTH=8;
endmodule
module top;
test #(16) OUT ( ) ;
endmodule
SOLUTION:  The value of parameter is 16

7. What is the bug in the following snippet?
module test;
parameter WIDTH=8;
endmodule
module top;
test OUT ( ) ;
initial
defparam OUT.WIDTH=10;
endmodule
SOLUTION:  Bug-'defparam' cannot be used inside an 'initial' block; it must be used outside procedural blocks.

8. What will be displayed in the console mode for the below snippet?
reg[13*8:1]s;
initial
begin
s = "hello world";
$display("Value of s= %s",s[104:65]);
end
SOLUTION: Value of s= hello [Because in ASCII 1char=8bit.]

9. What is the value of y in the below snippet?
reg [2:0] a, b;
reg y;
initial
begin
a= 3'd5;
b= 3'b111
y = a&&b;
end
SOLUTION: y=1

10. What is the value of x in the below snippet?
reg [2:0] a, b;
reg [2:0]x;
initial
begin
a=3'd5;
b=3’b111;
x= a | b;
end
SOLUTION: x = 3'111

11. What is the value of x in the below snippet?
reg [2:0]a;
reg [2:0]x;
initial
begin
a = 3'd4;
x = ^a;
end 
SOLUTION: 3'001  [4=100,,1^0^0= 1]

12. Evaluate the value of x in the below snippet.
reg [3:0]a;
reg [1:0]x;
initial
begin
a = 4'd10;
X= (a>>1);
end
SOLUTION: binary value of 10= 1010,
          a=1010,, a>>1 i.e 0101
          now value of x is 2'b01

13. Find the value of b in the below snippet.
reg [3:0]a;
reg [6:0]b;
initial
begin
a=4'd10;
b={a,1};
end
SOLUTION: b=7'0010101

14. Which block executes in the below snippet and justify the reason:
reg [3:0]a= 4'b110x;
initial
begin
if (a==4'b1100)
begin: B1
end
else
begin: B2 end
end
SOLUTION: B2 executes because the value of a is 110x ,the if block executes only the statement is true otherwise else is executed

15. Which block executes in the below snippet and justify the reason.
reg [3:0]a= 4'b110x;
initial
begin
if ( a !== 4'b1100)
begin: B1
end
else
begin: B2 end
end
SOLUTION: the block B1 executes ,because the value 110x is not exactly equal to 1100 .

16. What is the value of y in the below expression and justify the reason.
reg [3:0]a= 4'b110x;
wire y = (a== 4'b1100)?1'b1:1'b0;
SOLUTION: y= 1'b0, because if comapae the values 110x and 1100 the ans is 'x' .In conditional operator the true value is taken only when it is 1 otherwise it 0 whether it is 0 or x.

17. What is the value of y in the below expression and justify the reason.
reg [3:0]a= 4'b010x;
wire y = (a== 4'b1100)?1'b1:1'b0;
SOLUTION: y=1'b0

18. What is the value of b in the below expression and justify the reason.
reg [3:0]a= 4'b0100;
reg [3:0]b;
initial
begin
b = a+1'bx;
end
SOLUTION:b = 4'b0xxx
             In arithmetic operations, if any operand contains X, the result bits affected become X.Adding an unknown bit causes the carry to be unknown, which propagates to all higher bits.
             So the addition result becomes unknown except the LSB.

19. Implementing various gates using multiplexer
a. Implement AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR using multiplexer.
SOLUTION: mux
          s--> select line, io--> op when s=0, i1--> op when s=1
          y = ~s.i0 + s.i1
a)AND gate 
mux o/p = 1 only when A=1 and B=1
S = A
i0 = 0
i1 = B

b)OR gate 
S = A
i0 = B
i1 = 1

c)NAND gate
S = A
i0 = 1
i1 = ~B

d)NOR
S = A
i0 = ~B
i1 = 0

e)XOR
S = A
i0 = B
i1 = ~B

f)XNOR
S = A
i0 = ~B
i1 = B

20. Implement 4x1 Mux using continuous assignments, i.e. Data flow model.
a. Assign Y = S1 ? (S0 ? i3 : i2) : (S0 ? i1 : i0);
i. Do not code assign inside always
SOLUTION:  
module mux4to1(
input wire S0, S1,       
input wire i0, i1, i2, i3,  
output wire Y            
);
assign Y = S1 ? (S0 ? i3 : i2) : (S0 ? i1 : i0);
endmodule

21. Consider the following Verilog code using dataflow modeling
module Unknown (p,a,b,c);
output p;
input a,b,c;
wire q,r;
assign q=!((!a) && b && (!c));
assign r= !(a && (!b) && (!c));
and G1(p,q,r);
endmodule
If c = 0 the Boolean expression for p would be
A. NAND operation between variables a and b
B. NOR operation between variables a and b
C. XOR operation between variables a and b
D. XNOR operation between variables a and b
SOLUTION:
Step 1: Substitute c = 0
!c = 1
Then:
q = !((!a) && b && 1) = !((!a) && b) = a + !b 
r = !(a && (!b) && 1) = !(a && !b) = !a + b
Step 2: p = q AND r
p = q && r
  = (a + !b) && (!a + b)
Step 3:
a	b	a+!b	!a+b	(a+!b)&&(!a+b)
0	0	1	1	1
0	1	0	1	0
1	0	1	0	0
1	1	1	1	1

this shows that it performs XNOR operation between variables a and b.

22. What will be the value of x after executing the code? Justify your answer.
reg [3:0] x;
initial begin
x = 4'b0011;
fork
#5 x = x + 1;
#10 x = x + 2;
join
end
SOLUTION:
x = 6 (4'b0110) [DECIMAL 6]..fork ... join executes statements in parallel.Delays are independent.Blocking assignments (=) update the variable at the delayed time.So the operations happen sequentially in simulation time according to the # delays

23. What will be the final value of i and sum after the loop finishes executing?
reg [3:0] sum;
integer i;
initial begin
sum = 4'b0000;
for (i = 0; i < 4; i = i + 1) begin
sum = sum + i;
end
$display("i = %0d, sum = %b", i, sum);
SOLUTION:
i = 4
sum = 4'b0110

24. What value will be displayed for acc at the end of the code execution?
reg [3:0] acc;
initial begin
acc = 4'b0001;
while (acc < 4'b1000) begin
acc = acc + 1;
end
$display("acc = %b", acc);
end
SOLUTION:acc = 1000
