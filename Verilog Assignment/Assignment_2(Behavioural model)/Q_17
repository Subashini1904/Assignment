17. What is the output of following code?
int alpha, beta;
initial begin
alpha = 4; beta = 3;
beta <= beta + alpha;
alpha <= alpha + beta;
alpha alpha 2;
$display ("Alpha=%0d Beta=%0d", alpha, beta);
end

//SOLUTION//
alpha alpha 2;
This is syntactically wrong.
It must be one of the following 
alpha = alpha * 2;

Final output 
Alpha=8 Beta=3
