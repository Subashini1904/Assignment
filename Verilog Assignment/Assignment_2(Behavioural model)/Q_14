14. Initial value of a=1 and b=2, then what will be final value if

always @ (posedge clock)
a<=b;
always @ (posedge clock)
b<=a;


//SOLUTION//
         Initial: a = 1, b = 2
         After 1st clock: a = 2, b = 1
         After 2nd clock: a = 1, b = 2
There is no final stable value; a and b keep toggling (swapping) on every clock edge
