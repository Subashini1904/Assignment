4. Which of the statements will execute from the below snippet &
justify the behavior?
reg c = 3’b00x;
always@(*)
begin
casex( c )
3’b000:st1;
3’b100:st2;
3’b001:st3;
endcase
end

//SOLUTION//
 The statement 'st1' executes.
          Justification: In case x condition,multiple case items can match because 'x' is considered as dont care,but Verilog executes only the first matching case item and then exits the case.
