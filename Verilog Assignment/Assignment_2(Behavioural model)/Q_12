12.What will be the output of following code and if it is wrong what will be the correct code 
begin
  fork
    begin
      initial
      for (bit [2:0] i = 0; i <= 3; i++)
        $display($time, " value of i=%0d", i);
    end

    begin
      #1;
      $display("Executed 2nd begin block");
    end
  join

  $display("Fork Join Ended");
end

//SOLUTION//

0 value of i=0
0 value of i=1
0 value of i=2
0 value of i=3
Executed 2nd begin block
Fork Join Ended

THE CORRECTED CODE:
initial begin
  fork
    begin
      bit [2:0] i;
      for (i = 0; i <= 3; i = i + 1) begin
        #1;
        $display($time, " value of i=%0d", i);
      end
    end

    begin
      #1;
      $display("Executed 2nd begin block");
    end
  join

  $display("Fork Join Ended");
end
